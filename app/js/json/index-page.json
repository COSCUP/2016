        "從封閉到開源，從個人到社群，我們曾走過很長一段路。如今，邁向 2016 年的 COSCUP，除了延續過往一貫的「分享」精神外，更希望這種精神可以向外擴張、向下延續，成為使未來更好的力量。",
        "今年我們的主題著重在傳承、扎根與跨界三個部分：扎根方面，希望眾多微小的想法可以逐漸成形、發光；跨界方面，期望不同領域之間的組合出現令人驚喜的火花；至於傳承，我們更希冀能將現有的資源分享延續下去，成為更多新生代夥伴的發想基礎。",
        "COSCUP 2016 除了一般議程以外，我們更有工作坊、適合全家大小的親子工作坊，以及unconf、BoF等活動可以參與，讓我們一起來期待這場盛夏饗宴吧！"

        "From closed to open source; from individual to community, it’s been a long journey and we have arrived here in 2016, getting ready for COSCUP.  As well as continuing our long-standing spirit of “sharing”, we hope to extend and expand this mission further and to a wider audience; so it grows into a force that makes for a better future.",
        "This year we are focusing on the passing of the torch, and grassroot and interdisciplinary action. We hope to share and pass on knowledge gained so far so that it may become a foundation for brilliant ideas to come;  to encourage a constellation of small ideas to gradually form and shine in their own right; and to help the myriad of different discplines come together and erupt into beautiful sparks of genius.",
        "Not only will there be our usual program, here at COSCUP you can find workshops suitable for all ages, unconfs, BoFs and numerous activities to take part in. Let us all look forward to this summer festival of fun, I hope to see you there!"
